------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A lone traveler who towers above worlds in size and changes the color of his fluorescent glow depending on the closest star. 
It has been rumored that he has hieroglyphics all over his bones that glow sometimes(reasons unknown).
He is depicted as a God like hero to many forms of life. Often referred to as The Almighty Skele, The Savior, and sometimes, The Creator. 
However, there are many stories in ancient folklore that Skele is a horrid being who brings death by devouring worlds, along with other things...

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		
Skele himself, once spoke of his Creator. Although it is poorly translated.. 
Some refer to this entity as “Hand” because of certain hieroglyphics on Skele’s Skull. 

	Perhaps Hand is responsible for our expansive universe?

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
A shapeshifter whose usual appearance is that of a mad scientist.
He remains shrouded in mystery. His location is often unknown but you can often find his empire of evil androids lurking on every corner across the galaxies. He also can create organic life forms of pure evil and has been known to dabble in biological warfare. He is hilariously sinister and mischievous. His favorite hobby is experimenting on all life forms. 
	Oh, and he can harness dark matter but no one cares about that.
