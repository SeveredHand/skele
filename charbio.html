	<textarea name="comments" id="comments" style="width:50%;height:360px;background-color:black;color:green;">SKELE(Skelossus Xanthrax)
Age: Older than Time.
Race: Skeleton

A lone traveler who towers above worlds in size and changes the color of his fluorescent glow depending on the closest star. It has been rumored that he has hieroglyphics all over his bones that glow sometimes(reasons unknown).
He is depicted as a God like hero to many forms of life. Often referred to as The Almighty Skele, The Savior, and sometimes, The Creator. However, there are many stories in ancient folklore that Skele is a horrid being who brings death by devouring worlds, along with other things... (these stories could possibly have been birthed from propaganda forged by a mischievous demon)</textarea>
